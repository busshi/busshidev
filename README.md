## Usage

- `yarn install` to install node modules

- `yarn run build` to create the production build ready to be deployed

## Notes

- This website was coded in Typescript with NextJS. A goal was to create some cool components without installing existing libraries
- Some reusable hooks were created (a release will come soon in the [Node Package Manager](https://npmjs.com))
- No Redux or other store library but create my own context and provider
